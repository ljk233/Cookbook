# Mean

## Theory

The **mean** is the value that minimises the sum of the squared deviations.

## Recipe

Load the dependencies.

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats as st
```

Get things ready.

```python
X = pd.read_csv("../data/practicaltest.csv")["total"]
```

Return the sample mean.

```python
X.mean()
```
