# Cookbook

My collection of snippets and notebooks from working with Python over the years.

## Structure

The repo is split into two board categories: (1) Snippets, and (2) Notebooks.

Snippets are shortcode fragments with a single responsibility.

Notebooks are larger collections of snippets, and are used when the aim of the notebook cannot be achieved by a snippet.

## Dependencies

See *requirements.txt*.
