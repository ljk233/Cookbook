*2023-08-03*

## Note

The **standard deviation**:

- is a measure of dispersion for numeric data
- is the positive square root of the variance
- is a measure of the average dispersion of observations about the mean
- is sensitive to outliers
- has the same unit as the data

## Examples

Import the dependencies.

```python
import pandas as pd
```

Load the data.

```python
practical_test = pd.read_parquet("../data/practicaltest.parquet")
```

Return the *sample* standard deviation of the female pass rate.

```python
practical_test["female"].std()
```

Return the *population* standard deviation of the female pass rate.

```python
practical_test["female"].std(ddof=0)
```
