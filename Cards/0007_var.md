# Variance

*2023-08-03*

## Notes

The **variance**:

- is a measure of dispersion for numeric data
- is the average squared difference of the observations from the mean
- is sensitive to outliers
- has unit, **unit**<sup>2</sup>
  - For example, if some data on distance had unit **m**, then its variance would have unit **m**<sup>2</sup>

## Examples

Import the dependencies.

```python
import pandas as pd
```

Load the data.

```python
practical_test = pd.read_parquet("../data/practicaltest.parquet")
```

Return the *sample* variance of the male pass rate.

```python
practical_test["male"].var()
```

Return the *population* variance of the male pass rate.

```python
practical_test["male"].var(ddof=0)
```
