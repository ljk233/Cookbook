# Mode

*2023-08-03*

## Notes

The **mode**:

- is a measure of central tendency that is (generally) used for categorical data
- is the value of the observation that has the highest frequency
- is unit-free

## Example

Import the dependencies.

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats as st
```

Load the data.

```python
tattoo = pd.read_parquet("../data/tattoo.parquet")
```

Return the modal value of `score`.

```python
tattoo["score"].mode()
```

Return the modal value and count of `score`.

```python
tattoo["score"].value_counts()
```

Alternatively, if the data are numeric, we could use *SciPy*.

```python
st.mode(tattoo["score"])
```
