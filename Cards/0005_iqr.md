## Theory

The **interquartile-range** (IQR) is the difference between the first and the third *quartiles*.

## Recipe

Import the dependencies.

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats as st
```

Load the sample data.

```python
X = pd.read_csv("../data/schoolgirl.csv")["weight"]
```

Return the sample interquartile-range.

```python
st.iqr(X)
```
