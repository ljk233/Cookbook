# Interquartile-range

## Theory

The **interquartile-range** (IQR):

- is a mesasure of dispersion
- is the difference between the third and first quartiles
- is resistant to outliers
- has the same unit as the data

## Example

Import the dependencies.

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats as st
```

Load the data.

```python
school_girl = pd.read_parquet("../data/schoolgirl.parquet")
```

Return the interquartile-range of the weight of the school girls.

```python
school_girl["weight"].quantile(0.75) - school_girl["weight"].quantile(0.25)
```

Alternatively, we could use *SciPy*.

```python
st.iqr(school_girl["weight"])
```
